# MickShare

Did you ever have the need to send someone a rather large file and you did not want to use a full blown cloud solution for that little use case?

MickShare is the solution for you.
Hosted on the receiver's end, everyone with the right link can just upload files to the receiver's computer.
No uploaded file is ever executed, just saved on the Hard Disk.

MORE README IS COMING SOON
